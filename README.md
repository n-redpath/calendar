For the creative portion, we did three things:
1) Display events by category: For this part, users have the option of inputting a category when they create an event. They can also add in a category later. Then in the regular calendar view, they have an option to type in which category they want to see, and then only events from that category will appear. 
2) Jump by year: We added buttons that will jump a full year forward or backward in time
3) Share with user: When creating an event, users can input another username of a person they wish to share the event with, and then the event will also be added to that user's calendar. If users wish to share the events with people after they are created, then they can do this through the "invite another user" field. If the event is edited, the user can choose to edit the shared event on the other user's calendar as well by inputting the username of the person they shared with. This does not allow the creator of the event to edit any events on the other user's calendar that they did not create themselves.
